### What the application consists of?

It's a little JAVA project created to deal with the dining philosophers problem. You have the entire description on how the program works on Wikipedia. What a great tool! [It's this way!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) You have also a "read-me" file in French [available here](https://github.com/utarwyn/dining-philosophers-problem/blob/master/LisezMoi.pdf).

> Disclaimer: this tool has been designed and developed by me, so I think I do not use the better algorithm to try to explain the dining philosophers problem. Create your own algorithm and if you have any ideas of improvements, don't hesitate to contact me!

This tool uses **Java Semaphores** and a home-made user interface. \
The application needs **Java 8+** to work without problem.

### How I can test it?

You have just to download the latest release available [here](https://github.com/utarwyn/dining-philosophers-problem/releases). \
Then, start the program by typing `java -jar philosophers.jar` in a terminal opened at the JAR file location. You can also double-clicking on the file if you are on Windows.

### A screenshot maybe?

Absolutely yes! I even have a GIF! (yes it's a gif)
